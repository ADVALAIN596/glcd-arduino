== Introduction ==
This library makes it easy to use Graphical LCDs (GLCD) with Arduino.

This is an extensive modification of the ks0108 library that has higher performance, more features, supports more Arduino boards and is easier to integrate with different panels. 
Sketches written for the old library should work with little or no modification. The configuration mechanism has been changed to facilitate use with a broad range of GLCD chips and ATmega controllers.

See the section on sketch migration for details on modifications for the new library.
